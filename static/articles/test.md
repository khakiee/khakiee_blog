## Good stuff in your markdown

Markdown is pretty good but sometimes you just need more.

Sometimes you need a boinger like this:

Not many people have a boinger right in their markdown.

## Markdown in your markdown

Sometimes what you wrote last week is so good that you just *have* to include it again.

Yeah, thats right you can put wigdets in markdown (`.svx` files or otherwise). You can put markdown in widgets too.

### I wasn't joking

```
	This is real life
```

Sometimes you need your widgets **inlined**  because why shouldn't you.
Obviously you have access to values defined in YAML (namespaced under `metadata`) and anything defined in an fenced `js exec` block can be referenced directly.

Normal markdown stuff works too:

| like  | this |
|-------|------|
| table | here |

And *this* and **THIS**. And other stuff. You can also use all your favorite Svelte features, like `each` blocks:
- asdf
    - asdf
    - asdf
      - asdf
        - asdf

1. asdf
1. asdf
1. asdf
    1. asdf
    1. asdf
    1. asdf

and all the other good Svelte stuff.
